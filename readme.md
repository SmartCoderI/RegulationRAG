# Bay Area Regulations Enhanced RAG System

A state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to ask natural language questions about land development regulations across Bay Area cities. Features **hybrid search**, **streaming responses**, **hallucination detection**, and **resumable document ingestion**.

## 🚀 Key Enhancements

- ✨ **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic (vector) + keyword (BM25) search for superior accuracy
- 🔄 **Streaming Responses**: Real-time answer generation with immediate feedback
- 🛡️ **Hallucination Detection**: Smart "not included" responses prevent AI from making up information
- 📊 **Enhanced Filtering**: Advanced city and category filtering with dynamic dropdowns
- 🔁 **Resumable Ingestion**: Checkpoint-based document processing survives interruptions
- 🤖 **Optimized Models**: Uses lightweight `llama3.2:1b` for fast, reliable responses
- 🔍 **AI Reranking**: Optional Cohere integration for enhanced relevance (with API key)
- 📱 **Modern UI**: Advanced options panel with search type selection and real-time stats

## 🏗️ Enhanced Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with enhanced RAG service featuring hybrid search
- **LLM**: Ollama with `llama3.2:1b` (fast, reliable, 1B parameters)
- **Embeddings**: Nomic Embed Text (specialized for RAG applications)
- **Search Engine**: Hybrid BM25 + Vector search with optional AI reranking
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB with persistent storage and telemetry disabled
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript with Tailwind CSS and advanced UI components
- **Document Processing**: Resumable ingestion with MD5 change detection

## 🎯 How The Enhanced System Works

### 1. **Hybrid Search Pipeline**
```
User Question → [Embedding] → Vector Search (Semantic)
              ↘             ↗
                BM25 Search (Keyword) → Hybrid Ranking → Top Results
```

**Semantic Search**: Finds documents with similar meaning (e.g., "parking" matches "vehicle storage")  
**Keyword Search**: Finds exact term matches (e.g., "setback" finds exact regulatory terms)  
**Hybrid Ranking**: Combines both approaches for superior accuracy

### 2. **Streaming Response Generation**
```
Question → Document Retrieval → Context Building → LLM Streaming → Real-time UI Updates
```

- **Immediate Feedback**: Text appears word-by-word as generated
- **Better UX**: No blank waiting screens, feels conversational
- **Progress Indication**: Users see the AI "thinking" and responding

### 3. **Hallucination Detection System**
```
LLM Response → Relevance Check → Topic Analysis → "Not Included" Detection
```

**Multi-Layer Detection**:
- **Relevance Scoring**: Checks if document matches have high confidence (>0.5 threshold)
- **Topic Validation**: Detects questions about non-regulation topics (taxes, licenses, etc.)
- **Response Analysis**: Scans AI output for uncertainty phrases
- **Smart Fallback**: Provides helpful guidance about available topics

### 4. **Resumable Document Ingestion**
```
PDF Files → Change Detection → Chunking → Embedding → Vector Store → BM25 Index
    ↓           ↓               ↓          ↓           ↓            ↓
Checkpoint  MD5 Hash        Progress   Batch Save   Persistent   Search Ready
```

**Features**:
- **Session Management**: Track multiple ingestion runs
- **Interruption Recovery**: Ctrl+C saves progress, resume anytime
- **Change Detection**: Only re-process modified files (MD5 hashing)
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed documents (3 attempts)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time ETA and completion statistics

## 🚀 Enhanced Quick Start

### Option 1: Enhanced System (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the full enhanced system with all features
./start_enhanced.sh
```

### Option 2: Basic System
```bash

```

### What Happens During Startup:
1. **Environment Setup**: Creates `.env` with optimized model settings
2. **Dependency Installation**: Installs/updates all required packages
3. **Ollama Model Pull**: Downloads `llama3.2:1b` and `nomic-embed-text`
4. **Document Loading**: Automatically ingests sample Bay Area regulations
5. **Database Initialization**: Sets up ChromaDB with hybrid search indexes
6. **Service Launch**: Starts backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000)

## 📊 Enhanced Features Detailed

### 🔍 **Hybrid Search Modes**

**Vector Search (Semantic)**:
- Best for: Conceptual questions, synonyms, related topics
- Example: "parking requirements" finds "vehicle storage guidelines"

**Keyword Search (BM25)**:
- Best for: Exact terms, regulatory codes, specific numbers
- Example: "setback" finds exact "setback" mentions

**Hybrid Search (Recommended)**:
- Combines both approaches with intelligent ranking
- Best overall accuracy for complex regulation queries

### 🛡️ **Hallucination Prevention Examples**

**❌ Question**: "What are business tax requirements in Sunnyvale?"  
**✅ Response**: "I couldn't find information about business tax requirements in the Bay Area regulation documents. These documents focus on land development, zoning, and building regulations. For tax information, you might want to check the city's official tax department or business licensing office."

**✅ Question**: "What are parking requirements in Sunnyvale?"  
**✅ Response**: *[Provides accurate information from actual documents]*

### 📱 **Advanced UI Features**

- **⚙️ Advanced Options Panel**: Toggle search types, filters, and settings
- **📊 Real-time Stats**: Live document count, cities, and categories
- **🏙️ City Filter**: Dynamic dropdown with available cities
- **📂 Category Filter**: Filter by zoning, street standards, utilities, etc.
- **🔄 Streaming Toggle**: Enable/disable real-time response generation
- **🔍 Reranking Options**: Use Cohere AI for enhanced relevance (optional)

## 📝 Enhanced Example Questions

### Questions That Work Well:
- ✅ "What are parking requirements for multi-family housing in Sunnyvale?"
- ✅ "How wide must local streets be according to SF standards?"
- ✅ "What are the setback requirements for residential buildings?"
